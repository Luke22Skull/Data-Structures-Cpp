Data Structures in C++

This repository contains a collection of data structure implementations in C++, including common and advanced structures. Each structure is implemented in a separate header file, providing modular and reusable solutions. It includes:

    Arrays
    Stacks
    Queues
    Linked Lists
    Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix, Incidence Matrix)
    Binary Trees (BST, Binary Trees)
    Hash Tables

These implementations aim to serve as efficient, educational tools for learning and using data structures in real-world applications.
Features

    Simple and well-documented code.
    Suitable for educational purposes and use in projects.
    Flexible and reusable header files.
